#' Read collar data stored in CSV file(s)
#'
#' @param file_path The full path to one or more csv(s) to read
#' @param skip integer, the number of rows to skip at the top of the
#' file, see details
#' @param delim the delimiter to apply to the file, see ?readr::read_delim
#' @param rename_fun a function used to rename columns, see example
#' @param ... Other parameters to pass to readr::read_csv
#'
#' @details
#' Column names are adjusted using a custom function, but the user can pass any function they want to manipulate column names (e.g. make.names). The default removes non-ASCII characters, coerces all characters to lower case and replaces "." with "_".

#' # You might get into trouble if too many formats are contained in the same directory,
#' #  this will fail because column types are different. You could specify col_types
#' #  argument and pass it to readr::read_csv, but because different manufacturers use
#' #  different column names this won't work (col_types is not vectorized).

#' # Then find where the data start or do the following to skip lines
#' tlncs <- fetch_csv(fls[4], skip = which(r1[,1] == "Acquisition Time"))
