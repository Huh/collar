\title{Functions to build the url required to call the API}
\usage{
build_vec_url(base_url = NULL, collar_id = NULL, collar_key = NULL,
  type = c("gps", "act", "mit", "mor", "prx", "SEP", "TRAP"),
  after_data_id = NULL, start_date = NULL, which_date = NULL)

build_vec_urls(base_url = NULL, collar_id = NULL, collar_key = NULL,
  type = c("gps", "act", "mit", "mor", "prx", "SEP", "TRAP"),
  after_data_id = NULL, start_date = NULL, which_date = c("scts",
  "acquisition"))
}
\arguments{
\item{base_url}{NULL or the url to build from, the default NULL should
suffice in almost all cases}

\item{collar_id}{The ID(s) of the collars to query for data}

\item{collar_key}{The key(s) of the collars to query for data}

\item{type}{The data type, options include "gps", "act", "mit", "mor", "prx",
"SEP" and "TRAP".  See details.}

\item{after_data_id}{All data types have a unique ID maintained by the
manufacturer.  Use this parameter to download data after the supplied data
ID.  Must be equal in length to collar_id and collar_key.  Only one of
start_date and after_data_id may be supplied.}

\item{start_date}{A character vector specifying date and time as
DD-MM-YYYYTHH:MM:SS (the T is required, for example 01-01-2018T00:00:00).
Supplying this parameter will cause the API to only return data collected
after the supplied date.  Must be equal in length to collar_id and
collar_key.  Only one of start_date and after_data_id may be supplied.}

\item{which_date}{either scts or acquisition, indicates date column to use
for subsetting}
}
\value{
Formatted url(s) as a character string
}
\description{
The url is composed of a base that never changes, a collar id, a collar key
data type and either a start id or date at a minimum.  These pieces must be
put together in a rather particular order with appropriate punctuation.  This
is the role of these functions.
}
\details{
The functions build_vec_url and build_vec_urls differ only
in that build_vec_url builds a single url from a collection of length 1
arguments while build_vec_urls will function on vectors of inputs to
create numerous urls.  Functionally the user is encouraged to only use the
plural version so that code will function regardles of the length of the
input.

Data types are defined by the user and only a single data type is returned by
the API for any given call.  The url tells the API which data type to return,
such that passing
\itemize{
  \item "gps" returns location data
  \item "act" returns activity data
  \item "mit" returns implant mortality data
  \item "mor" returns mortality data
  \item "prx" returns proximity data
  \item "SEP" returns separation data
  \item "TRAP" returns trap event data
}
}
